//
// A MazeSolutionListener is an object that is notified whenever a MazeSolution
// has been changed (e.g., extended forward one cell).  Each MazeSolution has a
// collection of these listeners registered to it, and these listeners are then
// notified of changes.
//
// You're unlikely to need this yourself, though I used it in the GUI so that
// the maze's solution would be redrawn whenever it changed.
