// A MazeListener is an object that is notified whenever a Maze has been
// changed (e.g., having a wall removed).  Each Maze has a collection of
// these listeners registered to it, and these listeners are then notified
// of changes.
//
// You're unlikely to need this yourself, though I used it in the GUI so
// that the maze would be redrawn whenever the maze changed.
