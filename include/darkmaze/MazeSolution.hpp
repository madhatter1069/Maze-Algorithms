// MazeSolution.hpp
//
// ICS 46 Winter 2019
// Project #1: Dark at the End of the Tunnel
//
// Declares an abstract base class for MazeSolution implementations.  An
// implementation of this class is provided already, though the source code
// for it is not being provided to you.
//
// MazeSolutions, in general, have the following properties:
//
// * They know the size of the maze they're solving, given by a width and a
//   height
// * They know the starting and ending cells of the maze they're solving,
//   given by two std::pair objects, each containing an (x, y) coordinate.
// * They contain a sequence of movements, each in a particular Direction,
//   that lead from the starting cell.
// * They have a "current cell", which is where you would end up if you
//   made all the movements from the starting cell.  For example, if the
//   starting cell is (0, 0) and the movements are [right, right, down],
//   the current cell is (2, 1).
// * They know whether they've reached the ending cell.
// * They can be "extended," by adding one movement to the end of them.
// * They can be "backed up," by removing one movement from the end of
//   them.
// * They can have their entire sequence of movements replaced.
// * They can be "restarted," which removes all of their movements.
// * They can be cloned, meaning that, for some MazeSolution object of
//   type S, you can create a dynamically-allcoated copy of S that has
//   all the same properties.
// * They are "observable," which means that they have a collection of
//   "listeners" associated with them, who are notified whenever the
//   solution changes.  (This is primarily for use in the GUI.)
