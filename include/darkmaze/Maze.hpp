// Maze.hpp
//
// ICS 46 Winter 2019
// Project #1: Dark at the End of the Tunnel
//
// Declares an abstract base class for Maze implementations.  An implementation
// of this class is provided already, though the source code for it is not
// being provided to you.
//
// Mazes, in general, have the following properties:
//
// * They have a size, given by a width and a height
// * They are made up of cells with (x, y) coordinates, where 0 <= x <= width-1
//   and 0 <= y <= height-1.
// * They have a collection of walls vertically and horizontally that can
//   appear in between each pair of adjacent cells.  Walls can be added
//   and removed.
// * They can be cloned, meaning that, for some Maze object of type M, you can
//   create a dynamically-allocated copy of M that has all the same properties.
// * They are "observable," which means that they have a collection of
//   "listeners" associated with them, who are notified whenever the maze
//   changes.  (This is primarily for use in the GUI.)
